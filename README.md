Simple MediaPlayer Sample
=========================

I (gladapps) have forked this repo to modernize it and use it as a library in Android projects.
This sample has been updated to use Gradle 7.0.2, AGP 7.0.4 and more modern Android SDK buildToolsVersion and compileSdkVersion (v.31 as of this writing).
The Gradle repositories have been migrated off of JCenter to Google.
It has also been migrated to AndroidX.

Original Readme:
================
This sample has been deprecated/archived meaning it's read-only and it's no longer actively maintained (more details on archiving can be found [here][1]).

For other related samples, check out the new [github.com/android/media-samples][2] repo. Thank you!
